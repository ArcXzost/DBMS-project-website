# DBMS-project-website
This is a part of the DBMS project that I did in the 4th Semester of my BTECH curriculum.
The other part includes a GUI which guides you through the process of buying and selling your property on a realty called Matrix Real Estate.
You can find the entire project through the link github.com/Rainet473/Matrix-Real-Estate
However my contribution to the project was limited to the development of the website
